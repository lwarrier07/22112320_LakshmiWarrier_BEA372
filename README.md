 Lab 1 of data analytics
Given was the Dataset of a Bank (Bank.csv). 
The assignment aims to help us fetch data from a csv file.
It helps us to open a csv file without using any library or package
helps to get all the headers in the file
helps to count how many customers are present in each catagory in "marital" that is, married, single and divorced and,
lastly helps us to build a histogram using the scaling method.
By the end of the assignment, it helps us to be more confident about conditional statements, nested loops and extraction of data from csv file.
For example: while we fetched the data of how many customers are present in each catagory in marital, we made us of nested loops and dictionary.
